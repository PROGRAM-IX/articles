### Mafia III ###

Mafia III is a strange, strange game. It seems fixated on making life easy for you in some ways, and then in others makes life absolutely painful. Every time you think you're too frustrated to continue, it gives you something great that makes you want to push through because you remember what you loved about it.

I lose a lot of gunfights in this game. It might not seem it, considering that I finished it just before starting this, but I assure you - the number of times I enter a situation and just get gunned down is absolutely staggering. Not only that, but you don't even checkpoint back in time. You wake up at your nearest safe house, less half your in-pocket cash, and if you're lucky you only have to drive about a kilometre back to the house full of bad men, spending more cash on the way to pick up new body armour and medical supplies and grenades. But! When you do spend that money, the game is so slick at helping you. You can just hold L1 and call a dude with a soft voice and a van full of guns and other bits and pieces. He drives right up to you, and you just buy out of that van with no fuss whatsoever. A little later in the game than you get him, you get access to a nice lady who will also drive up, and bank your in-pocket cash for you so you aren't risking it. Incredible! Yet I can't respawn just nearby most big enemy encounters.

The disconnect is in the moment-to-moment combat, as well. As you upgrade Lincoln's abilities you can get _worryingly_ accurate with a pistol held at arm's length, to the point that I gave up on sniper rifles only about eight hours in. They just don't feel like the way to play this game. Not to mention that when sniping, you are almost always vulnerable to someone quite nearby that you can't see. The times when you can hide out in a nearby elevated position, a la Far Cry 3, and drop people before moving in to sort the remainder, are very few. So usually you're under fire already by the time you get to use a very loud long gun to kill people about 50 metres away. Certainly you will be under fire immediately that first shot goes off. And at that point, you feel like you may be doing the thing a bit wrong. So after a short-lived relationship with the shotguns in the game, I picked up a silenced pistol and eventually a silenced submachine gun and got to work. These were better because at least in theory, you are not immediately noticed when you kill someone stealthily using Lincoln's stone-steady hand. But in fairness to them, the enemies are pretty observant and will probably notice a dead person before long. It's a touch annoying when they seem to know where I am without having seen me or seen the kill, sometimes. But I'll live with that. What's tough to live with is that when they roll right up to my hiding place, and I know I can't pop out without exposing myself to more fire, the non-aimed shooting just feels so so terrible. The cursor absolutely flies around the screen, and no matter how I feather the trigger most guns jitter it around madly. I can basically kill twenty or thirty dudes if I'm methodical and pop them carefully, but if one - one! - walks around the back of the table I'm hiding behind, or whatever, swaggering with shotgun or automatic weapon, it all goes to pieces and I'm lucky to escape having only used a single healing item. Which are not that plentiful or useful starting off!

And yet. And yet. I want to go back into each of these fights over and over until I beat them, because this game is very good indeed at making its enemies into hateable cannon fodder. They call out mean things, have some extremely grim conversations between themselves, and in many cases can be found actually in the act of abusing a citizen somehow. So why not shoot them? Learning the flow of headshots makes the stealthy (or at least, slighly at a distance) combat feel great, as gross as the sounds might be. But if you don't have the execution, ahem, in the moment, you can always just riddle them with bullets instead. If you do that, almost invariably they will lie there miserably, crying or just in shock at their own impending death. It's quite a strange moment. When you exert your power over them, they become immediately pathetic, despite all their bluster up to then.
