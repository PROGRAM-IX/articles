### ASHEN ###

I've been playing a lot of Ashen in the last week or two. It's an action game involving a lot of directed exploration of a fair-sized world full of towers to climb and vistas to admire. Most people will probably compare it to Dark Souls and other From Software games, based on the similar combat/stamina/death mechanics, but they've done a lot that is interesting outside this similarity.

Rather than the sometimes gross but realistic-ish aesthetic the From games go for, Ashen is aiming squarely at a Sea of Thieves, or even lower-detail look for most characters (no facial features at all). It's a darkly cel-shaded world with details carefully applied where they will have most impact. It is beautiful in motion and at rest.

As for the directed exploration, you will definitely feel the difference to the vague 'ring the bells I guess?' instructions of Dark Souls. This game is far more concerned with making sure you know where to go, and more straightforward in handing out rewards along the way. There are 'main quests' and 'side quests' which almost invariably have a clear marker on the map (there's a map!), as well as a glowing icon in the world. In cases you don't know exactly where the item is, you always get a ping on the compass to say 'you're nearby!' when you enter the right area.


There is a light mechanic, too, in the sense that many of the areas you explore are at best grimy and poorly-lit, but you can have a lamp in your off-hand at the cost of not having a shield equipped there.

There are companion characters who will join you most of the time outside the hub area, and what's interesting about these is they can be other human players or AI! They appear as the same characters every time, usually the character who gave you your current quest. You can usually tell the real players from the AI by their doing weird stuff. Occasionally they'll wear a distinctive talisman from an early boss fight. They can revive you if you die, and you can do likewise for them, once each. They disappear when you return to the hub area.

The weapon upgrading is similar to those From Software games but the levelling-up or 'build' stuff is quite, quite different. Much more like Fallout perks. You have one main one and four smaller ones that you pay to change around. A lot of fun to mess with! Health and stamina upgrades come from feathers you find around the world, and from completing quests.

The hub area you end up returning to constantly to turn in quests. It feels very strange to travel just to turn in quests in a game like this, but as you do you'll see new buildings and improvements to existing buildings pop up around this little village you've founded. The hopeful tone this, and other elements of the plot, lend to the game is really wonderful, even if it sometimes gets a bit disorientating.

In general, I've found it *a little* easier than From Software's games so far, with only a couple of frustrating areas I found particularly tough. While I don't know how long it is yet, I'm more than happy with it so far and maybe you would be too!
